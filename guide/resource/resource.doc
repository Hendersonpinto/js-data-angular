# Resource Guide

A _resource_ is the data and meta data associated with a particular RESTful endpoint.

You define _resources_ and register them with the data store. A _resource definition_ tells angular-data
about a particular _resource_, like what its root endpoint is and which attribute refers to the primary key of the
resource. A _resource definition_ can also specify validation functions to be executed before create and update
operations.

See [defineResource(definition)](/documentation/api/api/DS.sync_methods:defineResource) for detailed API information.

The simplest resource definition:

```js
DS.defineResource('document');
```

With this definition the data store assumes the following:

- Resource will be referred to as `"document"`
- The RESTful endpoint for this resource is `"/document"`
- The `idAttribute` (attribute that specifies the primary key) is `"id"`
- This resource does not use any validation

An advanced resource definition:

```js
DS.defineResource({
	name: 'document',
	idAttribute: '_id',
	endpoint: 'documents',
	validate: function (attrs, cb) {
		if (!angular.isObject(attrs) {
			cb('Must be an object!');
		} else if (!angular.isString(attrs.title)) {
			cb('title must be a string!');
		}
	}
});
```

With this definition the data store understands the following:

- Resource will be referred to as `"document"`
- The RESTful endpoint for this resource is `"/documents"`
- The `idAttribute` (attribute that specifies the primary key) is `"_id"`
- Before create/save operations the provided `validate` function must pass
